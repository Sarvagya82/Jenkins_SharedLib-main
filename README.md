# Jenkins Shared Library
- Shared libraries in Jenkins Pipelines are reusable pieces of code that can be organized into functions and classes.
- These libraries allow you to encapsulate common logic, making it easier to maintain and share across multiple pipelines and projects.
- Shared library must be inside the **vars** directory in your github repository
- Shared library uses **groovy** syntax and file name ends with **.groovy** extension.
